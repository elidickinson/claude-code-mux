# Create RapidSpec Proposal

Transform feature descriptions, bug reports, or improvements into well-structured RapidSpec proposals with automated verification and research.

## Feature Description

<feature_description> #$ARGUMENTS </feature_description>

## Main Tasks

### 1. Parallel Verification & Research

<thinking>
First, I must verify the current codebase state and research best practices.
Run multiple specialized agents in parallel to gather comprehensive context.
This prevents "imaginary code" and ensures evidence-based proposals.
</thinking>

<critical_requirement>
MUST verify actual code exists before proposing. No "imaginary code".
All file references must be verified with Read, Grep, or Git commands.
</critical_requirement>

Run these agents in parallel at the same time:

Investigation agents:
- Task git-history-analyzer(affected_files)
- Task pattern-recognition-specialist(affected_files)

Research agents:
- Task best-practices-researcher(feature_description, technology_stack)
- Task framework-docs-researcher(detected_framework)

**Verification Checklist:**

- [ ] Read actual files with `@file/path`, `Grep`, `Glob`
- [ ] Check git history: `git log --oneline -- path/to/file`
- [ ] Find existing patterns in codebase
- [ ] Document all findings with specific file paths (e.g., `src/app/page.tsx:42`)

**Research Collection:**

- [ ] WebSearch for latest patterns (e.g., "Next.js 16 caching patterns 2025")
- [ ] Check reference repositories (midday-ai, dub, epic-stack)
- [ ] Read library CHANGELOG.md for breaking changes
- [ ] Analyze git log for past decisions: `git log --all --grep="keyword"`
- [ ] Include URLs to external documentation and best practices guides

### 2. Synthesize Research & Present Options

<thinking>
Analyze all agent findings to form 2-3 concrete implementation options.
Each option must include verified "Before" code with file:line references.
Consider trade-offs: time, risk, complexity, and pattern alignment.
</thinking>

**Option Structure:**

Present 2-3 concrete approaches with:
- **Before** (verified actual code with @file:line)
- **After** (proposed changes)
- **Pros/Cons/Cost** (time, risk, complexity)
- **Pattern Match** (how it aligns with project conventions)
- Mark recommended option with ⭐

**Example Presentation:**

```markdown
### Option 1: Client + DB Unique Constraint ⭐ (Recommended)
**Before:** @src/app/dashboard/page.tsx:42 - No duplicate check
**After:** Add client validation + unique index on `links` table
**Pros:** Strong data integrity, prevents race conditions
**Cons:** Migration required, slightly slower inserts
**Cost:** Time: 2h, Risk: Low, Complexity: Medium
**Pattern Match:** ✅ Follows @midday-ai/midday deduplication pattern

### Option 2: Client Warning Only
**Before:** @src/app/dashboard/page.tsx:42 - No duplicate check
**After:** Show warning toast if duplicate detected
**Pros:** No migration, fast implementation
**Cons:** No DB enforcement, race conditions possible
**Cost:** Time: 30m, Risk: Medium, Complexity: Low
**Pattern Match:** ⚠️ Not recommended for production
```

### 3. Wait for User Decision

<thinking>
Present options clearly and wait for user confirmation.
User may choose option number, say "yes" (go), or "wait" (wait) to reconsider.
</thinking>

**User responses:**
- User replies with "1", "2", "3", or option number
- User says "yes" (go) to proceed with recommended option
- User says "wait" (wait) or "no" (no) to change direction

**DO NOT proceed to file generation until user confirms their choice.**

### 3.5 Design Review (Before File Generation)

<thinking>
After user selects option, validate architecture and design decisions.
Run design-focused agents to catch issues before implementation starts.
This prevents building with flawed architecture.
</thinking>

<critical_requirement>
MUST run design review agents in parallel based on detected changes.
MUST incorporate design feedback into proposal before scaffolding files.
Design issues caught now are 10x cheaper to fix than during implementation.
</critical_requirement>

**Run these agents in parallel based on selected option:**

**If Database changes detected:**
  - Review schema design, indexes, constraints
  - Validate migration safety and rollback plan
  - Suggest performance optimizations (denormalization, caching)
  - Check RLS policies before writing
  - Confirm index strategy for query patterns

**If Next.js/React changes detected:**
- Task nextjs-architecture-expert(component_structure, routing, selected_option)
  - Review Server/Client Component split
  - Validate routing and data fetching patterns
  - Check metadata and caching strategy
  - Suggest layout and page structure
  - Validate async params/searchParams usage

**Design Review Checklist:**

After agents complete:
- [ ] Schema design validated (if DB changes)
- [ ] Migration safety confirmed (if DB changes)
- [ ] Component architecture approved (if Next.js changes)
- [ ] Data fetching strategy validated (if Next.js changes)
- [ ] Design feedback incorporated into proposal
- [ ] Ready to scaffold files with validated design

**Example Design Review:**

```
User selected: Option 1 (Client + DB Unique Constraint)

Running design review...

@agent-database-architect:
✓ Schema design: unique index on (user_id, release_id) - correct
⚠️ Migration safety: Add CONCURRENTLY for zero downtime
💡 Performance: Consider partial index if soft-deletes exist
✓ RLS: Policy design looks good

@agent-nextjs-architecture-expert:
✓ Server Component for data fetching - correct
✓ Client Component only for toast interaction - minimal
⚠️ Consider: Add loading.tsx for better UX
💡 Suggestion: Use parallel routes for modal if needed

Incorporating feedback...
✓ Updated migration to use CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY
✓ Added loading.tsx to tasks
✓ Design validated, ready to scaffold
```

### 4. Scaffold with CLI then Fill Templates

<thinking>
First run CLI to scaffold template files, then fill them with research findings.
This ensures consistent structure and prevents missing files.
</thinking>

<critical_requirement>
MUST run `rapid proposal <change-id>` CLI command first to scaffold templates.
MUST fill ALL scaffolded files with agent research findings.
NEVER skip files - populate proposal.md, tasks.md, investigation.md, research.md, and spec deltas.
</critical_requirement>

**Step 4a: Scaffold Templates**
```bash
# Run CLI to create template files
rapid proposal <change-id>
```

This creates the directory structure and template files.

**Step 4b: Fill the Templates**

Now populate these scaffolded files in `rapidspec/changes/<change-id>/`:

**`proposal.md`** - Chosen option with before/after diffs:
```markdown
# Change: [Brief Description]

### 5. Validate Strictly

<thinking>
Run validation to ensure proposal meets all quality standards.
Use rapid show to verify generated files are correct.
</thinking>

```bash
# View generated proposal
rapid show <change-id>

# View deltas only (save tokens)
rapid show <change-id> --json --deltas-only

# Validate structure and content
rapid validate <change-id> --strict
```

Resolve all validation issues before completing.

## Examples

### Example 1: Feature Addition

```
User: "/rapid:proposal Smart Links duplicate prevention"

AI thinking:
→ Need to verify current smart links implementation
→ Research duplicate prevention patterns
→ Check git history for past decisions

AI executes in parallel:

Investigation:
→ Read codebase → Found @src/app/dashboard/smart-links/page.tsx:127
→ Task git-history-analyzer → Found commit fd2db07 "allow duplicates for A/B testing"
→ Task pattern-recognition-specialist → Found similar validation pattern in @src/app/dashboard/projects

Research:
→ Task best-practices-researcher → Found UX patterns for deduplication
→ Task framework-docs-researcher → Next.js 16 form validation patterns

AI synthesizes:
✓ Current code allows duplicates (verified at line 127)
✓ Past decision: duplicates were intentional for A/B testing
✓ Existing pattern: project creation already has duplicate check (should follow same pattern)
✓ Research: midday.ai uses client + DB unique constraint
✓ Framework: Next.js recommends server actions with zod validation

AI presents:
### Option 1: Client + DB Unique Constraint ⭐
- Time: 2h, Risk: Low, Pattern: 100% match with midday.ai
### Option 2: Client Warning Only
- Time: 30m, Risk: Medium (no DB enforcement)

AI: "Which option? Reply '1' or '2'"
User: "1"

AI generates:
✓ proposal.md with verified Before/After code
✓ investigation.md with git findings
✓ research.md with midday.ai references
✓ tasks.md with 5 checkpoints
✓ specs/smart-links/spec.md with deltas
```

### Example 2: Bug Fix

```
User: "/rapid:proposal fix 409 token refresh error"

AI executes in parallel:

Investigation:
→ Task git-history-analyzer → No mutex implementations found in history

Research:

AI synthesizes:
✓ Issue reproduced: Concurrent refresh → 409 (no mutex protection)
✓ Alternative: midday uses p-limit for older versions

AI presents options and waits for choice
```

## Anti-Patterns

❌ **Don't: Generate "imaginary code" without verifying**
```
Bad: "I'll update the middleware to add token validation"
→ Never checked if middleware exists!
→ Never verified current token handling!
```

✅ **Do: Investigate first with agents, then propose**
```
Good: "Running parallel investigation and research...

Investigation:
→ Read @src/middleware.ts:42 - Current auth logic
→ git-history-analyzer: Refactored yesterday in commit abc123

Research:
→ best-practices-researcher: Found Next.js 16 middleware patterns

Based on investigation and research, here are 3 options..."
```

❌ **Don't: Research without context**
```
Bad: WebSearch "authentication best practices"
→ Generic results, not tailored to codebase
```

✅ **Do: Use specialized agents**
```
Good: Task framework-docs-researcher(next.js, authentication)
→ Gets Next.js-specific auth patterns
→ Checks project's Next.js version
→ Returns relevant examples
```

## Reference

- Search existing requirements: `rg -n "Requirement:|Scenario:" rapidspec/specs`
- Inspect proposal: `rapid show <id> --json --deltas-only`
- Check specs: `rapid show <spec> --type spec`
- Show diffs (Before → After) with file:line references
- Verify code exists before proposing - never assume or use "imaginary code"

## Notes

- **Always run agents in parallel** for faster context gathering
- **Wait for user confirmation** before generating files
- **Use RapidSpec format** for all proposal files
- **Verify everything** with actual code reads, never assume
