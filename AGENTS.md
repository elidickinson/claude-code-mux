# RapidSpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/rapidspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:
- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Use `@/rapidspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:
- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines
- Project constitution and development principles
- Code quality standards and best practices

Keep this managed block so 'rapid init' can refresh the instructions.
